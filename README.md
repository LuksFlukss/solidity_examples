# Solidity Examples
In this repo you will find some basic soldity smart contracts code, to help you understand the basicis

## What is Solidity? 
Solidity is a high-level contract-oriented language. Its syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and is specifically focused on the Etehreum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed and accepts, among other things, inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types.

## Execution
* ```git clone https://github.com/LuksFlukss/solidity_examples```
* Go to a Ethereum Smart Contract Deployer, [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
* Deploy the Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain
